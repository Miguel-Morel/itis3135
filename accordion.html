            <div>
                <p>
                    The next chapter in the Elder Scrolls saga arrives from the Bethesda Game Studios. Skyrim reimagines
                    the open-world fantasy epic, bringing to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any
                    way you choose. Play any type of character you can imagine, and do whatever you want; the legendary
                    freedom of choice, storytelling, and adventure of The Elder Scrolls is realized like never before.
                    Skyrim's new game engine brings to life a complete virtual world with rolling clouds, rugged
                    mountains, bustling cities, lush fields, and ancient dungeons. Choose from hundreds of weapons,
                    spells, and abilities. The new character system allows you to play any way you want and define
                    yourself through your actions. Battle ancient dragons like you've never seen. As Dragonborn, learn
                    their secrets and harness their power for yourself.
                </p>

            <h3>Fire Emblem: Awakening</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Lead an army of soldiers in a series of scaled turn-based strategy battles. In the process, develop
                    relationships with your team, utilizing their special abilities on the battlefield to gain victory
                    and advance the story, which features a wide array of characters from a variety of nations and
                    backgrounds. They can be joined by a character of your making, with a unique appearance crafted as
                    you see fit.

                    what has become of the ruined kingdom of Hyrule in this open-air adventure. Explore the wilds of
                    Hyrule any way you like.

            <h3>Pokemon Soulsilver</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Return to the beloved Johto region first introduced in the Pokémon Gold and Silver Version games for the
                portable Game Boy system. Several new enhancements for the series, such as updated graphics and touch
                screen features, enrich these timeless adventures, and the new Pokéwalker accessory allows players to
                take their favorite Pokémon with them wherever they go. Both games feature detailed graphics that
                spotlight the unique environments and hundreds of Pokémon that players can encounter and catch. Players
                can even see and interact with their favorite Pokémon outside of battle, selecting one from their team
                to follow behind them as they travel through the Johto region.
